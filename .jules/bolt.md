## 2025-02-27 - O(N^2) trap in loop-scoped Set initialization
**Learning:** Initializing sets inside a loop to perform uniqueness checks against an accumulating list causes quadratic performance degradation (O(N^2)), as the set is repeatedly rebuilt from a growing list on every iteration.
**Action:** Always lift deduplication set initialization outside of accumulation loops, and update the sets incrementally inside the loop alongside the list.
